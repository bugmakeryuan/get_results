# get_results
This is a simple program to copy contents from several folders to a txt file.

# This program is my first Python program. Yes, I'm a novice who just start learning Python recently. Fortunately, this program is so simple that it won't break down.

# This program is created to copy the optical properties (such as Light absorption efficiency, Light scattering efficiency, and Light extinction efficiency) from a lot of optical calculation folders. I am too lazy to copy a line from so many folders one by one.

# Usage: 
  Put "get_opticalproperties.py" in the folder including the optical calculation folders. 
  You will find your result in "result.txt":)
