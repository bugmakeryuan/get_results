# get_results
This program is my first Python program. 

This is a simple program to copy contents from several folders to a txt file. It copies the optical properties (such as Light absorption efficiency, Light scattering efficiency, and Light extinction efficiency) from a lot of optical calculation folders. I am too lazy to copy a line from so many folders one by one.

# Usage
  Put "get_opticalproperties.py" in the folder including the optical calculation folders. 
  You will find your result in "result.txt":)
